      <p>Last updated: May 28, 2025</p>

      <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using any applications operated by ladevzo ("us", "we", or "our", collectively, "the Apps").</p>
      <p>Your access to and use of the Apps is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Apps.</p>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By accessing or using any of our Apps, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Apps.</p>

      <h2>2. Services Provided</h2>
      <p>ladevzo provides various applications designed to enhance your interaction with your Google Photos library and other media. While features vary by app, services typically include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allowing users to select photos and videos from their Google Photos library via the Google Photos Picker API.</li>
        <li>Displaying metadata and content of selected media (as seen in <strong>EXIF Viewer</strong> or used in a <strong>Slideshow</strong> app).</li>
        <li>Facilitating the creation and management of media items and albums within your Google Photos via the Google Photos Library API.</li>
        <li>Offering tools for organizing, enhancing, or interacting with your media in novel ways.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our Apps act as viewers, organizers, or creators that integrate with your Google Photos and do not provide persistent storage services for your actual media content.</p>

      <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for your own use of the Apps and for the content you choose to display, create, or manage through them.</p>
      <p>You agree to use the Apps in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and not for any unlawful or prohibited activities.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge that the Apps rely on access to your Google Photos, and that your use of Google Photos is governed by Google's own terms of service.</p>

      <h2>4. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>The Apps are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the operation or availability of the Apps or the information, content, materials, or products included on the Apps.</p>
      <p>We do not guarantee that the Apps will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. We are not responsible for any issues arising from your use of Google Photos or the Google Photos APIs.</p>

      <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>In no event shall ladevzo, nor its owner(s), be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Apps; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Apps; (iii) any content obtained from the Apps; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

      <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

      <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
